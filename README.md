# Computational-Topology

## Language and API Used
[Python](https://www.python.org/) - Python was used as the main language to accomplish computational topology. <br />
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Matplotlib was used for the graphing and mapping <br />
[scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - Scikit was used to acomplish the statistics portion of the computational topology <br />
[Kepler Mapper](https://kepler-mapper.scikit-tda.org/en/latest/) - Kepler Mapper was used to create an HTML file for the data visualization <br />

## Description
The main purpose of this repo is to experiment and learn how to create Computational Topology programs with the use of APIs such as scikit, matplotlib, and Kepler Mapper. As well as to eventually branch into machine learning and topology using python.

## Resources 
These are the main resources that I used to learn the basics of topology as well what the sturcture would look like in python.
I highly reccomend the talks, tutorials and workshops from Bastian Rieck to understand the theory behind topology. <br/>
